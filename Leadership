Project 1

1. Solicit feedback from your team members
    To Kraig:
      It sucks that your initial work wasn't saved. That made it look like you put things off until the last minute. Next
      time just make sure your work gets to the others in the group. We can all work on communicating with each other
      more clearly so that we don't have to rush to debug in the end.
        -Hunter
    To Zach:
      Like I said to Kraig, we could all improve by communicating more frequently and clearly during the next project.
      I think you could have benefitted in your role as the compiler of the different parts of code by following up with 
      the rest of us earlier on so that we didn't learn about most of the bugs the day before the project was due. The blame
      for that problem does fall on all of us, however, so don't feel like I'm singling you out. Overall, we got the 
      project done in the end!

2. Summarize the feedback and write a statement of what you'd like to do differently on the next project
    do this part on your own in a word doc
